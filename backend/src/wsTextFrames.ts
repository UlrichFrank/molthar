/**
 * Makes engine.io 4 (socket.io 3, pulled in by boardgame.io) work with Bun's
 * WebSocket server.
 *
 * Bun's built-in `ws` follows ws@8 semantics and emits text frames as
 * Buffers. engine.io 4 expects ws@7 semantics (text frames as strings) and
 * decodes a Buffer as a binary packet, so the socket.io namespace handshake
 * fails and every WebSocket connection is closed right away. Clients then
 * fall back to HTTP long-polling, which exhausts the browser's per-host
 * connection limit when one page runs several clients (own seat + NPCs) and
 * delays moves by several seconds.
 *
 * engine.io loads a custom engine via `require(<name>)` at runtime, which a
 * compiled single binary cannot resolve. Instead, the default 'ws' server is
 * patched in place — under Bun every `require('ws')` returns the same module,
 * so engine.io picks up the patch. The server applies it only under Bun; on
 * Node (ws@7) messages carry no `isBinary` flag and would pass through anyway.
